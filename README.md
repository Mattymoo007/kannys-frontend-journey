## Workflow

### For Each Step
1. Create a branch: `step-XX-name`
2. Read the step's README for requirements
3. Work on the project, commit often
4. Open a PR when ready for review
5. Address feedback, then merge

### Weekly Check-ins
- Review progress and PRs
- Discuss blockers and theory
- Set goals for the next week
- Update `progress/weekly-log.md`

## AI-Assisted Learning

AI tools are encouraged throughout this journey:

**Do:**
- Use AI to explain concepts
- Debug with AI assistance
- Generate boilerplate, then modify and understand
- Ask "why" questions

**Don't:**
- Copy-paste without understanding
- Skip the learning process
- Use AI for entire solutions without attempting first

**Weekly question:** "What did you learn using AI that you couldn't have figured out as quickly on your own?"
