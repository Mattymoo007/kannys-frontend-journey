# Step 8: API Integration

## Overview

Build a Weather Dashboard that fetches real-time data from a weather API. Learn to work with external APIs, handle async operations, and display dynamic data.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Step 7 (Nuxt Basics)

## Learning Goals

- Fetch data from external REST APIs
- Handle loading and error states
- Parse and display JSON data
- Work with environment variables

## Requirements

### Setup
- [ ] Choose a weather API (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.)
- [ ] Set up API key in environment variables
- [ ] Create Nuxt project with API integration

### API Integration
- [ ] Fetch current weather by city
- [ ] Display temperature, conditions, humidity
- [ ] Show weather icon based on conditions
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully

### User Experience
- [ ] Add city search functionality
- [ ] Show loading state while fetching
- [ ] Display meaningful error messages
- [ ] Save recent searches

### Advanced
- [ ] Add 5-day forecast
- [ ] Implement location-based weather (geolocation)
- [ ] Cache API responses

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can search for any city's weather
- [ ] Current weather displayed clearly
- [ ] Loading and error states handled
- [ ] Recent searches saved

- [Nuxt useFetch](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch)

## AI Practice

- Debug API calls with AI
- Ask AI to explain API response structures
- Use AI to handle edge cases
