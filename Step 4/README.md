# RGB Guesser Game

## Introduction 🌈

Welcome to the RGB Guesser Game project! This is an exciting and interactive way to test your understanding of RGB color values and JavaScript skills. In this game, the program generates a random RGB color value, and the player's task is to guess which color corresponds to this value from a set of six options. You'll have three attempts to get it right!

## Project Requirements 🎨

- **Random RGB Generation:** Implement a function to generate a random RGB value (e.g., "rgb(255, 0, 0)"). This will be the correct answer.
- **Additional RGB Options:** Create five more random RGB values for the guessing options.
- **UI Design:** Update the UI to display all six color blocks on the screen, each representing one of the RGB values.
- **Guessing Mechanism:** Allow the user to click on a color block to make a guess.
- **Attempt Count:** Limit the number of guesses to three. After three incorrect guesses, the player loses.
- **Restart Option:** Include a button to restart the game with new colors after a win or loss.
- **Display Correct Answer:** If the player loses, reveal the correct color block.

## Learning Goals 🎯

- Enhance your understanding of JavaScript functions, arrays, and event handling.
- Practice manipulating the DOM to update the game's UI dynamically.
- Develop logic for randomly generating RGB values and implementing game mechanics.
- Strengthen your skills in JavaScript conditionals and loops.

## Success Criteria 🏆

- A functional RGB color guessing game matching the project requirements.
- Clean, readable, and well-commented JavaScript code.
- A user-friendly interface with a clear indication of game status (win/lose).
- Efficient code that accurately checks for the correct answer and limits guesses.

🌟 Dive into this colorful challenge and let your JavaScript skills shine! Remember, each problem you solve and line of code you write is making you a better developer. Enjoy the process and have fun with your creation! 🎮🎨👾
