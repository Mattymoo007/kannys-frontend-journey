# Company Home Page Project 🌐

## Introduction 📜

Welcome to the Company Home Page Project! In this assignment, you will be tasked with recreating our company's home page using HTML and CSS. This will give you an opportunity to apply your knowledge on semantic HTML, CSS selectors, flexbox/grid, and media queries.

The design you'll be referencing is based on a Figma file, which provides an in-depth visual representation of what the finished product should look like.

## Project Requirements 📝

1. **Semantic HTML**: Ensure you use the correct semantic HTML tags to express the page structure.
2. **CSS Styling**: Use vanilla CSS to style the page according to the design provided in the Figma file. This should involve the use of flexbox or grid and the right CSS selectors.
3. **Responsive Design**: The page should be fully responsive. Utilize media queries to adjust the layout for various screen sizes.
4. **Utility Classes**: Earn extra points by creating utility classes, especially for buttons (e.g., `.btn`).
5. **Interactivity**: Implement hover styles on links, navigation items, and other elements where applicable.
